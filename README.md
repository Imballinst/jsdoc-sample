# jsdoc-sample

A sample JSDoc usage for my blog post. There are 2 main file here:

1. `index.js` is more like introduction to basic JavaScript comments and how modern IDEs (in this case, I use VSCode) are able to derive it as JSDoc comments.
2. `test.js` is the file to test the output and the effect of the JSDoc comments, which increases developer experience by a fine margin because of the autocomplete feature.

Other 2 folders, `with-jsdoc` and `without-jsdoc`, contains the exact same copy of these 2 files below. However, the former contains JSDoc comments, while the latter doesn't.

1. `calculator.js` is a file containing a sample `sum` functions.
2. `db.js` is a file containing a sample database of a certain type.
